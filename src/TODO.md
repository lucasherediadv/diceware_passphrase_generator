- Modularize your code: Break down your code into smaller, reusable functions or classes. This will make your code more readable and maintainable. For example, you could create a function to load the word list, another to roll the dice, and so on.

- Error handling: Add error handling to your code. For example, what happens if the file ‘eff_wordlist.txt’ does not exist or cannot be read? Your program should be able to handle such situations gracefully.

- Use constants for file paths: Instead of hardcoding the file path (‘list/eff_wordlist.txt’), you could define it as a constant at the top of your script. This makes it easier to change the file path later if needed.

- Add comments and docstrings: While you have some comments and docstrings in your code, you could add more to explain what each part of your code does. This is especially important for more complex parts of your code.

- Unit tests: You’ve already noted this in your TODOs, but adding unit tests is a great way to ensure your code is working as expected and makes it easier to catch bugs early.

- Type hinting: Again, you’ve noted this in your TODOs. Type hinting can make your code easier to understand and reduce the likelihood of bugs.

- Learn about .venv/ and requirements.txt or pyproject.toml: These are related to managing dependencies in Python. A virtual environment (.venv) is a way to keep the dependencies required by different projects separate. requirements.txt and pyproject.toml are used to specify what python packages are required to run the project.
